# Description: Create a contact form with inline validation, success/failure states, and a mailto fallback.
# Details:
Use React Hook Form for inline validation. Implement success and failure states for form submission. Include a mailto fallback in case the form submission fails. Ensure the form is accessible and meets accessibility standards.

# Test Strategy:

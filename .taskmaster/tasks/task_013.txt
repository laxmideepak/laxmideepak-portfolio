# Task ID: 13
# Title: Refactor Components to Use CSS Variables
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Update all components in the components/ directory to use CSS variables for colors instead of hard-coded values, ensuring compatibility with both light and dark modes
# Details:
1. Identify all color-related CSS properties in components/ directory
2. Replace hard-coded color values with CSS variables: --bg-primary, --text-primary, --border, --link-color
3. Ensure variables are properly defined in the global theme system (refer to Task 12 for variable definitions)
4. Implement conditional styling for light/dark modes using CSS media queries and prefers-color-scheme media feature
5. Add support for theme switching by making components responsive to the data-theme attribute
6. Validate that all components maintain their visual integrity and functionality across both modes
7. Test color contrast ratios to ensure accessibility standards are met
8. Update any component-specific overrides or custom styles to use the new variable system
9. Document any component-specific styling decisions in the component's README or documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify CSS variables are correctly applied to all components
2. Test components in both light and dark mode configurations
3. Check color contrast ratios using accessibility tools
4. Validate theme switching functionality without breaking existing styling
5. Ensure all components maintain their visual integrity and functionality
6. Perform cross-browser testing to confirm consistent behavior
7. Review component documentation for any styling decisions made during the refactor

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a bunch of context about tasks and subtasks, and a specific user request related to completing the FallbackLocationCard component. The goal is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on the user's request.

First, I need to look at the existing subtask details. The current subtask 7.2 is titled "Integrate Fallback with LocationProvider" and has some details about creating the FallbackLocationCard. The user's request says they've completed the component with several features like dynamic error messages, browser-specific guidance, retry button, design matching, responsive design, accessibility features, gradient background, hover effects, etc.

The task is to append new information to the subtask's details. The existing details mention creating the component with a static world graphic, displaying messages, retry button, design matching, responsive design, and theme support. The user's request adds more specifics like dynamic error messages based on error types, browser guidance, accessibility features, gradient background, hover effects, and visual appeal.

So, the new text should list all the completed features from the user's request. I need to make sure not to include any existing details unless the user asks to modify them. Since the user is saying the component is ready for integration, the new text should detail all the completed aspects. I'll list each point from the user's request as bullet points, ensuring they are concise and match the structure of the existing details. Also, need to avoid any markdown and keep it plain text. Let me check if all the points are covered and formatted correctly.

Okay, let's see. The user has provided a detailed context about their tasks and subtasks, and they want me to generate new text to append to the current subtask's details based on their request.

First, I need to understand the user's request. They mention that they've completed the integration of LocationProvider with the fallback UI. The key points they list include updating the LocationProvider to handle unavailable states, adding showFallback state, integrating retryLocation, handling error states, managing permission status, and integrating the FallbackLocationCard with retry functionality. They also note that the LocationProvider now properly handles all error states and shows the appropriate fallback UI.

Looking at the existing subtask details, the current subtask (7.2) is about integrating the fallback with LocationProvider. The existing details mention updating the LocationProvider to handle unavailable states, showing the FallbackLocationCard when permission is denied or location is unavailable, adding retry functionality, handling different error states, and providing user feedback. The user's request seems to be confirming that these tasks have been completed, so the new text should reflect that completion.

The user's request is essentially a summary of what was done. The new text needs to be added to the subtask's details, so I should capture all the completed items from the user's message. However, I need to make sure not to repeat existing details unless the user asks to rephrase or modify. Since the user's request is about completing the subtask, the new text should detail the completion of each point mentioned in their request.

I should list each completed item as a bullet point, ensuring that each point from the user's request is included. The existing subtask details already have some of these points, but the user's request adds more specifics, like the showFallback state, retryLocation function, and proper state management. These should be included in the new text.

I need to avoid any markdown and keep it as plain text. Also, the response should not include any timestamps or special formatting. The generated text should be concise but cover all the user's points. Let me structure each completed task as a bullet point, making sure to mention the integration of the LocationProvider, the states handled, the retry functionality, error handling, user feedback, and the integration with the FallbackLocationCard. Also, the user mentioned state management for fallback visibility, which should be included.

Wait, the existing subtask details already mention some of these points. The user's request is confirming that these have been completed, so the new text should be a summary of the completed work. I need to make sure that the new text doesn't duplicate existing details but adds the specific completions mentioned in the user's request. For example, the user's request adds "showFallback state" and "retryLocation function," which might not have been in the original subtask details. So those should be included in the new text.

Putting it all together, the new text should list each completed item from the user's request, ensuring that all the points are covered without repeating existing details. The final output should be a plain string with each point as a bullet point, using hyphens and no markdown.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a lot of context about tasks and subtasks related to creating a fallback UI for when location is unavailable. The current subtask is 7.3, which is about adding error state handling and user guidance. The user has completed some work and wants to append new information to the subtask's details.

Looking at the user request, they mention completing error state handling and user guidance with several points like comprehensive error handling, specific messages for different scenarios, browser-specific instructions, accessibility features, and more. The existing subtask details already include some of these points, like adding error messages, guidance, browser instructions, graceful degradation, and accessibility. 

The user's request seems to be updating the subtask to reflect that all those points have been completed. The new information to append would be the list of completed items they mentioned. However, I need to make sure not to repeat existing details unless the user asks to rephrase or modify. Since the user is adding new completed tasks, I should list those as the new content. 

Wait, the existing subtask details already have some of these points. The user's request is to append the new text based on their completion. So the new text should be the list of completed items they mentioned, but I need to check if any of those are already in the existing details. For example, "Add specific error messages for different failure scenarios" is already in the existing details. The user's request adds more specifics like "denied, unavailable, and timeout cases," which might be new. Also, "Enhanced test page to showcase fallback functionality" and "Added fallback mode indicator in test controls" might be new additions not in the original subtask details. 

So the new text should include the completed items that weren't previously listed. The user's request includes points like "Enhanced test page..." and "Integrated retry functionality..." which weren't in the original subtask details. Therefore, the new text to append would be those specific additions. I need to make sure not to include the existing points again unless the user wants to rephrase. Since the user is providing a completion status, the new text should be the list of completed tasks that weren't already in the subtask's details. 

Putting it all together, the new text should mention the enhanced test page, fallback mode indicator, retry functionality, and the specific error messages for denied, unavailable, and timeout cases. Also, the accessibility features with ARIA labels and the graceful degradation for unsupported browsers might already be in the existing details, so maybe those are already covered. The key is to include the new elements the user added. So the final answer should list those new points as the appended text.

- Enhanced test page to showcase fallback functionality  
- Added fallback mode indicator in test controls  
- Integrated retry functionality with proper user feedback  
- Specific error messages for denied, unavailable, and timeout cases  
- Browser-specific instructions for enabling location services  
- Accessibility features for error states with proper ARIA labels  
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

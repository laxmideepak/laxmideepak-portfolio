Okay, let's see. The user has completed the installation of Mapbox GL JS dependencies. They mentioned installing the package with --legacy-peer-deps, adding the token to .env.local, and setting up TypeScript types. The subtask's current details include those steps, so the user's request is about confirming that these steps are done.

The user's message says the project is ready for integration. The next subtask is creating the map component with lazy loading. Since the dependencies are installed and configured, the next step is to move to component development. The new text should reflect that the dependencies are completed and the component can be developed now. I need to append this information to the subtask details without repeating existing steps. So, the new content should mention the completion of dependencies and readiness for component development.

âœ… Completed Mapbox GL JS dependency installation:  
- Successfully installed mapbox-gl package with --legacy-peer-deps  
- Installed @types/mapbox-gl for TypeScript support  
- Created .env.local file with NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN placeholder  
- Dependencies are ready for component development  
- Environment configuration is set up for token management  

Project is now ready for Mapbox GL JS integration. Next step: implement lazy-loaded map component with dynamic import and ssr: false configuration.

## 2. Create Map Component with Lazy Loading [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a React component for Mapbox map with lazy loading
### Details:
- Create MapboxMap component using dynamic import
- Implement lazy loading with ssr: false
- Add proper error boundaries and loading states
- Configure map styles and initial view
- Handle component lifecycle properly

Okay, let's see. The user has completed the Mapbox map component with lazy loading. They want to append this information to the subtask details. The current subtask is 3.2: Create Map Component with Lazy Loading. The existing details mention creating the MapboxMap component with dynamic import, lazy loading with ssr: false, error boundaries, loading states, map styles, initial view, and lifecycle management.

The user's request lists several completed items: dynamic import, LazyMapboxMap wrapper with Next.js dynamic import and ssr: false, loading states, error handling, pulsing user location marker with CSS animation, navigation controls, map styling, environment variable validation for the token, cleanup, lifecycle management, Suspense for smooth loading, and responsive design with Card components. The map is now ready for integration with the location feature.

I need to generate the new text to append. The existing details already have some of these points, like dynamic import and lazy loading. The user's request adds more specifics like the LazyMapboxMap wrapper, Suspense, responsive design with Card components, and the pulsing marker with CSS animation. Also, environment variable validation and lifecycle management are mentioned. The user also mentions the component is ready for integration with the location feature.

So, the new text should include all the completed items from the user's request that aren't already in the existing details. For example, the LazyMapboxMap wrapper, Suspense, the pulsing marker, environment variable validation, and the readiness for integration. Also, the responsive design with Card components might be part of the existing details, but since the user specifically mentions it, it should be included. Need to make sure not to repeat existing points. Let me check the existing implementation details again. The existing ones include creating the component with dynamic import, lazy loading with ssr: false, error boundaries, loading states, map styles, initial view, and lifecycle management. The user's points add the wrapper, Suspense, pulsing marker, environment validation, and readiness. So the new text should list these additions. Also, the user's request mentions the component is ready for integration, which should be noted. So the new text would be a list of these completed items, ensuring they are not already in the existing details.

## 3. Configure Environment and Security [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up environment variables and security configuration for Mapbox
### Details:
- Add Mapbox token to .env.local
- Configure domain restrictions for the token
- Set up proper environment variable handling
- Add security headers for Mapbox resources
- Ensure HTTPS-only access

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a bunch of context about tasks and subtasks related to integrating Mapbox GL JS into a project. The current subtask in question is 3.3, which is about configuring the environment and security for Mapbox. The user's request is a completion report for this subtask, detailing all the steps they've taken to set up the environment and security configurations.

First, I need to understand what the user wants. They mention that they've completed the environment and security configuration, listing several actions like updating Next.js config with CSP headers, adding security headers, creating a validation utility, enforcing HTTPS, setting domain restrictions, integrating validation into the MapboxMap component, error handling for tokens, and configuring CSP to allow Mapbox resources. They also state that the security configuration is now complete and ready for production.

The task is to generate the new text that should be appended to the subtask's details based on this user request. The existing subtask details already include some of these points, like adding the token to .env.local, configuring domain restrictions, setting up environment variables, adding security headers, and ensuring HTTPS. However, the user's request adds more specifics, such as the env-validation utility, integrating it into the component, error handling, and CSP configuration details.

I need to make sure that the new text doesn't repeat existing information but adds the newly completed tasks. The user's request includes items like the env-validation utility, which wasn't mentioned in the original subtask details. Also, the integration of validation into the MapboxMap component and the error handling for missing/invalid tokens are new points. The CSP configuration details, such as allowing Mapbox resources while maintaining security, are also new.

So, the new text should list these completed actions, ensuring that each point is concise and directly relates to the subtask's goal of environment and security configuration. I should avoid mentioning the existing details unless the user's request explicitly asks to rephrase or modify them. Since the user's request is about completing the subtask, the new text should focus on the completed steps that weren't previously detailed in the subtask's implementation details.

I need to structure the new text as a list of bullet points, each describing a completed action. The user's request already provides these points, so I'll format them into a coherent list without any markdown. Also, the user mentions that the configuration is now complete and ready for production, so that should be included as a concluding statement.

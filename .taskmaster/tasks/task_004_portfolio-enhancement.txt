# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Project Cards with Tech Tags
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create project cards that display title, one-line metric-based result, tech tags, and Live/Code buttons.
# Details:
Use TailwindCSS for styling and ensure cards are responsive. Include a 'Live' button to open the project in a new tab and a 'Code' button to link to the GitHub repository. Add tech tags to indicate the technologies used in each project.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that each card is styled correctly and that the buttons function as expected. Check that tech tags are displayed and that the links open correctly.

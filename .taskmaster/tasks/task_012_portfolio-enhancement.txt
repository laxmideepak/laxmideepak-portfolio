# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Mobile Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the site is optimized for mobile devices with safe-area insets, ≥44px tap targets, and prefers-reduced-motion support.
# Details:
Use TailwindCSS to ensure safe-area insets are applied. Ensure all tap targets are at least 44px in size. Support reduced motion preferences to avoid animations on mobile devices.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the site is optimized for mobile devices. Check that safe-area insets are applied, tap targets are ≥44px, and reduced motion preferences are supported.

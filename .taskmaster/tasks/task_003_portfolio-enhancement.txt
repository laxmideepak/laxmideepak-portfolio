# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design Hero Section with Two CTAs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a hero section with two calls-to-action buttons: 'View My Work' and 'Download Résumé'.
# Details:
Use TailwindCSS for styling and ensure the buttons are visually distinct. Implement the 'View My Work' CTA to scroll to the projects section. The 'Download Résumé' CTA should trigger a download of the PDF resume.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the buttons are styled correctly and functional. Check that the 'View My Work' CTA scrolls to the projects section and the 'Download Résumé' CTA downloads the PDF.

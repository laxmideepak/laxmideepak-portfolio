The user has provided a request that they've already completed, and they want to update the subtask details. The subtask in question is \"Implement Geolocation API Integration\" with the status pending. The user's request details what they've done: created the LocationPermissionModal component with various features like clean UI using shadcn/ui Dialog, proper loading states, privacy-focused messaging, Privacy Policy link, responsive design, accessibility features, and dark mode support. They mention the component is ready for integration with the geolocation API.\n\nThe existing subtask details include creating a modal/toast with shadcn/ui, clear messaging, Privacy Policy link, handling user interaction, and state management. The user's request adds more specifics about the implementation, like the UI components used, loading states, error handling, shield icon, responsive design, ARIA labels, and dark mode. \n\nThe task is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on the user's request. The existing details are for context, but the user's request provides new information that wasn't in the original subtask. So, the new text should list the completed features from the user's request, ensuring it's concise and doesn't repeat existing details. \n\nI need to make sure not to include any original details unless the user asks to modify them. Since the user's request is about what was done, the new text should reflect the completed work. The response should be a plain string without any markdown or formatting.

The goal is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on the user's request.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing subtask details. The current subtask is 4.2: Integrate Permission Modal with Real Geolocation. Its implementation details include updating the modal to use real geolocation, connecting actions to the useGeolocation hook, handling success/error cases, storing permission status in localStorage, and providing user feedback.\n\nThe user's request says they've completed the integration, listing several points like updating the modal to use the useLocation hook (wait, maybe they meant useGeolocation?), connecting modal actions to real API calls, adding error handling, loading states, optional callbacks, error display with red styling, connecting to LocationProvider, and error logging. They also mention the modal now works with real geolocation API calls.\n\nSo the task is to append this information to the subtask's details. The existing details already mention some of these points, like connecting to the hook and handling errors. But the user's request adds more specifics, such as optional callbacks, red styling for errors, integration with LocationProvider, and error logging. Also, they mention using the useLocation hook, which might be a typo for useGeolocation. I should check if that's a mistake, but since the user wrote it that way, I'll include it as is.\n\nThe new text should list all these completed items, making sure not to repeat existing details unless necessary. Since the user's request is about what's been completed, the new text should reflect those completed actions. I need to structure it as a list, ensuring each point is concise and matches the user's request. Also, avoid any markdown and keep it plain text.

The goal is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on the user's request.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's request. They mention completing reverse geocoding implementation with several points: using Nominatim API, caching in localStorage for 24 hours, error handling, integrating into LocationProvider, address formatting, cache management, automatic updates when position changes, and proper User-Agent headers. The location card now shows real addresses from coordinates.\n\nLooking at the current subtask details (Subtask 4.3), the existing implementation details include integrating the API, converting coordinates, caching, error handling, and updating the LocationCard. The user's request seems to be confirming that all these points have been completed. \n\nThe task context shows that Subtask 4.3 is in-progress, but the user's request indicates it's done. The user wants to append new information to the subtask's details. The existing details already mention some of the points in the user's request, like using Nominatim, caching, error handling, etc. However, the user's request adds specifics like the 24-hour cache, clearCache function, automatic updates on position change, and User-Agent header compliance. \n\nSo, the new text should include the completed items from the user's request that weren't already in the existing subtask details. For example, the User-Agent header compliance and the clearCache function might not have been mentioned before. Also, the automatic address updates when position changes and the specific caching duration (24 hours) are new details. \n\nI need to make sure not to repeat existing information but add the new specifics. The user's request also mentions integrating into LocationProvider and address formatting with street, city, state, country, which might already be in the existing details. So the key is to highlight the completed aspects that were part of the user's request but weren't previously detailed in the subtask. \n\nPutting it all together, the new text should list the completed tasks from the user's request, focusing on the new elements like the 24-hour cache, clearCache function, User-Agent compliance, and automatic updates.

So the new text should add the specifics from the user's request without repeating the existing points. \n\nThe user's request includes items like color variants, size variants, tooltip functionality, etc. These are new details that weren't in the original subtask.

The current details mention adding the custom marker to the MapboxMap component, centering the map on user coordinates, updating the marker's position in real time, handling positioning and centering, ensuring smooth transitions, and adding error handling. \n\nThe user's request lists several completed tasks: integrating the custom pulsing marker, replacing the default with an HTML-based one, proper positioning with anchor points, CSS animations for pulsing, ARIA labels, centering, error handling, smooth transitions, custom styling with z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. \n\nI need to check what's already in the current subtask details and what's new in the user's request. The existing details already mention some of these points, like centering the map, updating position in real time, smooth transitions, and error handling. However, the user's request adds specific elements like replacing the default marker with HTML-based, custom CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index layering, and visibility across zoom levels. \n\nSo, the new information to append should include the points that weren't in the original subtask details. That would be the replacement of the default marker, the CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. Also, the user mentions successful integration, which might be part of the status update, but since the status is already \"done\" in the previous subtask, maybe the focus is on the implementation details. \n\nI need to make sure not to repeat existing details. For example, the original subtask mentions \"Add the custom marker to the MapboxMap component\" and \"Update marker position in real time when location changes,\" which are covered in the user's request. But the specifics like HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, etc., are new. \n\nSo the new text should list these additional points. The user's request also mentions \"Successfully integrated custom pulsing marker into MapboxMap component\" which might be part of the status, but since the subtask is already marked as done, the focus is on the details. Therefore, the new content should include the specifics like replacing the default marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. \n\nI should structure this as a list of new implementation details or updates to the existing ones. The user's request also mentions \"proper error handling for marker positioning\" which was already in the original details, so that's not new. \n\nPutting it all together, the new text should highlight the HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. Also, the successful integration and handling of the marker's positioning with anchor points. \n\nWait, the original subtask details already mention \"Add proper error handling for marker positioning,\" so that's already there. The user's request adds \"Added proper error handling for marker positioning\" again, but maybe that's redundant. However, the user's request might be emphasizing that it's completed, so perhaps the new text should include all the points from the user's request that aren't already in the original subtask details. \n\nSo the new text should include: replaced default with HTML-based, custom CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index layering, visibility across zoom levels, and proper anchor point configuration. Also, the successful integration and handling of transitions and error handling. \n\nBut since the original subtask already has some of these, like error handling and transitions, the new text should focus on the additional points. Therefore, the new content would be the HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels.

The user's request seems to be confirming that these tasks have been completed, so the new text should reflect that completion.\n\nThe user's request is essentially a summary of what was done. The new text needs to be added to the subtask's details, so I should capture all the completed items from the user's message. However, I need to make sure not to repeat existing details unless the user asks to rephrase or modify. Since the user's request is about completing the subtask, the new text should detail the completion of each point mentioned in their request.\n\nI should list each completed item as a bullet point, ensuring that each point from the user's request is included. The existing subtask details already have some of these points, but the user's request adds more specifics, like the showFallback state, retryLocation function, and proper state management. These should be included in the new text.\n\nI need to avoid any markdown and keep it as plain text. Also, the response should not include any timestamps or special formatting. The generated text should be concise but cover all the user's points. Let me structure each completed task as a bullet point, making sure to mention the integration of the LocationProvider, the states handled, the retry functionality, error handling, user feedback, and the integration with the FallbackLocationCard. Also, the user mentioned state management for fallback visibility, which should be included.\n\nWait, the existing subtask details already mention some of these points. The user's request is confirming that these have been completed, so the new text should be a summary of the completed work. I need to make sure that the new text doesn't duplicate existing details but adds the specific completions mentioned in the user's request. For example, the user's request adds \"showFallback state\" and \"retryLocation function,\" which might not have been in the original subtask details. So those should be included in the new text.\n\nPutting it all together, the new text should list each completed item from the user's request, ensuring that all the points are covered without repeating existing details. The final output should be a plain string with each point as a bullet point, using hyphens and no markdown.\n</think>\n\n- Integrated LocationProvider with fallback UI handling for all error states  \n- Implemented showFallback state to dynamically control fallback visibility  \n- Added retryLocation function for location re-request with user feedback  \n- Fully handled denied, unavailable, and timeout error scenarios  \n- Enhanced permission status logic to trigger fallback on denial  \n- Added clear user guidance for each error case with actionable retry  \n- Linked FallbackLocationCard with retry functionality for seamless recovery  \n- Established robust state management for fallback UI visibility toggling\n</info added on 2025-08-04T23:40:01.876Z>",

They provided a lot of context about tasks and subtasks related to creating a fallback UI for when location is unavailable. The current subtask is 7.3, which is about adding error state handling and user guidance. The user has completed some work and wants to append new information to the subtask's details.\n\nLooking at the user request, they mention completing error state handling and user guidance with several points like comprehensive error handling, specific messages for different scenarios, browser-specific instructions, accessibility features, and more. The existing subtask details already include some of these points, like adding error messages, guidance, browser instructions, graceful degradation, and accessibility. \n\nThe user's request seems to be updating the subtask to reflect that all those points have been completed.

So the new text should be the list of completed items they mentioned, but I need to check if any of those are already in the existing details. For example, \"Add specific error messages for different failure scenarios\" is already in the existing details. The user's request adds more specifics like \"denied, unavailable, and timeout cases,\" which might be new. Also, \"Enhanced test page to showcase fallback functionality\" and \"Added fallback mode indicator in test controls\" might be new additions not in the original subtask details. \n\nSo the new text should include the completed items that weren't previously listed. The user's request includes points like \"Enhanced test page...\" and \"Integrated retry functionality...\" which weren't in the original subtask details. Therefore, the new text to append would be those specific additions. I need to make sure not to include the existing points again unless the user wants to rephrase. Since the user is providing a completion status, the new text should be the list of completed tasks that weren't already in the subtask's details. \n\nPutting it all together, the new text should mention the enhanced test page, fallback mode indicator, retry functionality, and the specific error messages for denied, unavailable, and timeout cases.

They provided a lot of context about tasks and subtasks related to adding accessibility features, specifically focusing on implementing keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. The user's request is a checkmark list indicating they've completed various ARIA-related tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the existing subtask details. The current subtask 9.2 is \"Implement Keyboard Navigation\" with pending status. The user's request is about completing ARIA labels and screen reader support, which seems to relate to subtask 9.1, which is \"Add ARIA Labels and Screen Reader Support\" and is in progress. However, the user's message is about completing those tasks, so maybe they want to update the status of subtask 9.1 or 9.2?\n\nWait, the user's request is a list of completed items. The original subtask 9.2 is about keyboard navigation, but the user's request is about ARIA labels and screen reader support, which are part of subtask 9.1. However, the user might be trying to update subtask 9.2's details by adding the completed ARIA work. But the user's request is about completing ARIA labels and screen reader support, which are part of subtask 9.1. \n\nWait, the parent task is \"Add Accessibility Features\" with subtasks 9.1 (ARIA labels and screen reader support) and 9.2 (keyboard navigation). The user's request is about completing the ARIA labels and screen reader support, which would be part of subtask 9.1. However, the user's message is structured as a completion of those tasks, so maybe they want to update subtask 9.1's details to reflect that those items are done. But the user's request is presented as a completion of those tasks, so the new information to append would be the details of what was done. \n\nLooking at the user's request, they list all the completed ARIA-related tasks. The existing subtask 9.1's implementation details include adding aria-labels, role attributes, etc. The user's request adds more specifics, like role attributes for dialog, region, status, alert, complementary elements, aria-labelledby and aria-describedby, aria-live regions with polite and assertive settings, aria-hidden for decorative icons, focus management for modals, role=\"alert\" for error messages, descriptive labels for buttons, and semantic structure with IDs. \n\nSo the user wants to append this detailed list of completed tasks to subtask 9.1's details. However, the user's request is presented as a completion of those tasks, so the new text to append would be the list of completed items. But the existing subtask 9.1 already has some implementation details. The user's request is adding more specific details. Therefore, the new information to append would be the list of completed ARIA tasks as provided in the user's request. \n\nBut the user's request is already part of the existing subtask 9.1's details? Wait, looking back, the current subtask 9.1's implementation details include adding aria-labels, role attributes, aria-describedby, etc. The user's request adds more specifics, like role attributes for specific elements, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-live regions with different politeness levels, aria-hidden for icons, focus management, role=\"alert\" for errors, descriptive labels for buttons, and semantic structure with IDs. \n\nTherefore, the new text to append to subtask 9.1's details would be the user's request content, which is the list of completed tasks. However, the user's request is presented as a completion, so the new information is that all those items have been completed. Therefore, the new text should be the user's request content, formatted as a list of completed tasks, which would be added to the subtask's details. \n\nBut the user's request is already part of the existing subtask 9.1's details? Wait, no. The existing subtask 9.1's implementation details are listed, but the user's request is a more detailed list of completed tasks. So the new information to append would be the user's request content, which is the detailed list of completed ARIA tasks. Therefore, the answer should be the user's request content, formatted as a list, but without the markdown. \n\nWait, the user's request is a list of completed items. The existing subtask 9.1's implementation details include some of these points, but the user's request adds more specifics. Therefore, the new text to append would be the user's request content, which is the detailed list of completed tasks. So the answer is the user's request content, formatted as a plain string without markdown. \n\nBut the user's request is already in the context.

The existing details include things like adding keyboard shortcuts for location permission, tab navigation, Enter/Space key support, Escape key for closing modals, focus indicators, and logical tab order. \n\nNow, the user's request lists more specific completions. They mention adding Ctrl/Cmd + L for location permission, tab navigation with focus indicators, Enter/Space for buttons, Escape to close modals, focus management with contrast, logical tab order, additional shortcuts for retry and clear, enhanced ARIA labels, documentation in the test interface, useCallback for event handling, and preventDefault to avoid conflicts.\n\nThe task is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on the user's request. The existing details already have some of these points, but the user's request adds more specifics. For example, the user mentions \"retry\" and \"clear\" shortcuts, which weren't in the original details. Also, the documentation in the test interface and the useCallback with preventDefault are new points.\n\nI need to make sure that the new text includes all the items from the user's request that aren't already covered in the existing subtask details. The existing details mention keyboard shortcuts for location permission, tab navigation, Enter/Space, Escape, focus indicators, and logical tab order. The user's request adds retry, clear, ARIA labels with shortcuts, documentation, useCallback, and preventDefault. \n\nSo, the new text should list all these additional points. I should structure them in a clear, bullet-point format without using markdown. Also, the user wants only the new information, so I need to exclude any existing details from the original subtask. \n\nWait, the user's request starts with \"✅ Completed keyboard navigation implementation:\" followed by a list.

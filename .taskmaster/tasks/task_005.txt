Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a bunch of context about tasks and subtasks, and a specific user request that says they've completed a custom pulsing marker component. The goal is to generate new text to append to the subtask's details based on that request.

First, I need to look at the existing subtask details. The current subtask is 5.2: Integrate Marker with MapboxMap Component, which is pending. The existing details mention creating a custom marker with pulsing animation, implementing CSS animations, positioning, accessibility, ARIA labels, testing performance, etc.

The user's request says they've completed all those points and added more features like color variants, size variants, tooltip functionality, shadow and contrast, animation delay, etc. The task is to append this information to the subtask's details. 

So, the new text should list all the completed items from the user's request. But I need to make sure not to include any existing details unless the user asks to modify them. Since the user's request is about what's completed, the new text should be the list of completed tasks from the request. 

I should check if any of the existing details in the subtask are already covered in the user's request. For example, the original subtask mentions "Implement CSS animations for the pulsing effect" and the user's request says they implemented CSS animations for different colors. So the new text should add the specifics from the user's request without repeating the existing points. 

The user's request includes items like color variants, size variants, tooltip functionality, etc. These are new details that weren't in the original subtask. So the new text should list all those completed items as additions to the subtask's details. 

I need to format this as a plain string, without any markdown or special formatting. Just the list of completed tasks. Also, make sure not to include any timestamps or other irrelevant info. The key is to take the user's request and convert it into the new content to append, ensuring it's concise and complete.

Okay, let's see. The user has provided a lot of context about their tasks and subtasks. The main focus here is on Subtask 5.2, which is "Integrate Marker with MapboxMap Component." The user's request is to append new information to this subtask's details based on their completed work.

First, I need to look at the existing details for Subtask 5.2. The current details mention adding the custom marker to the MapboxMap component, centering the map on user coordinates, updating the marker's position in real time, handling positioning and centering, ensuring smooth transitions, and adding error handling. 

The user's request lists several completed tasks: integrating the custom pulsing marker, replacing the default with an HTML-based one, proper positioning with anchor points, CSS animations for pulsing, ARIA labels, centering, error handling, smooth transitions, custom styling with z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. 

I need to check what's already in the current subtask details and what's new in the user's request. The existing details already mention some of these points, like centering the map, updating position in real time, smooth transitions, and error handling. However, the user's request adds specific elements like replacing the default marker with HTML-based, custom CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index layering, and visibility across zoom levels. 

So, the new information to append should include the points that weren't in the original subtask details. That would be the replacement of the default marker, the CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. Also, the user mentions successful integration, which might be part of the status update, but since the status is already "done" in the previous subtask, maybe the focus is on the implementation details. 

I need to make sure not to repeat existing details. For example, the original subtask mentions "Add the custom marker to the MapboxMap component" and "Update marker position in real time when location changes," which are covered in the user's request. But the specifics like HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, etc., are new. 

So the new text should list these additional points. The user's request also mentions "Successfully integrated custom pulsing marker into MapboxMap component" which might be part of the status, but since the subtask is already marked as done, the focus is on the details. Therefore, the new content should include the specifics like replacing the default marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. 

I should structure this as a list of new implementation details or updates to the existing ones. The user's request also mentions "proper error handling for marker positioning" which was already in the original details, so that's not new. 

Putting it all together, the new text should highlight the HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. Also, the successful integration and handling of the marker's positioning with anchor points. 

Wait, the original subtask details already mention "Add proper error handling for marker positioning," so that's already there. The user's request adds "Added proper error handling for marker positioning" again, but maybe that's redundant. However, the user's request might be emphasizing that it's completed, so perhaps the new text should include all the points from the user's request that aren't already in the original subtask details. 

So the new text should include: replaced default with HTML-based, custom CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index layering, visibility across zoom levels, and proper anchor point configuration. Also, the successful integration and handling of transitions and error handling. 

But since the original subtask already has some of these, like error handling and transitions, the new text should focus on the additional points. Therefore, the new content would be the HTML-based marker, CSS animations, ARIA labels, z-index, and visibility across zoom levels. Also, the anchor point configuration was mentioned in the user's request as part of proper positioning. 

So the final new text should list these points as added implementation details.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a bunch of context about tasks and subtasks related to a project involving a map with a user location pin. The main focus is on Subtask 5.3, which is about testing and optimizing marker performance. The user's request is to append new information to this subtask's details based on their completed work.

Looking at the user's request, they've listed several completed tasks under "✅ Completed marker performance testing and optimization." These include testing the marker's appearance, verifying the pulsing animation with custom CSS, confirming updates on location changes, testing different zoom levels, checking accessibility, testing on different devices and browsers, confirming integration with MapboxMap, smooth transitions, visibility, error handling, animation optimization, and cross-browser compatibility.

The existing subtask details already mention some of these points, like testing marker appearance, verifying the animation, checking performance across zoom levels, accessibility, testing on devices and browsers, and optimizing animation. However, the user's request adds more specifics, such as the exact zoom level tested (12x), the use of ARIA labels for accessibility, successful build on the development server, confirmation of custom marker integration, smooth transitions, visibility and positioning accuracy, error handling, CSS timing optimization, and cross-browser compatibility.

So, the new information to append should include all these points that weren't in the original subtask details. The user wants to add their completed tasks, which include more detailed testing results and specific optimizations. I need to make sure that the new text doesn't repeat existing details but adds the new findings and confirmations from the user's request. Also, the response should be a plain string without any markdown or formatting, just the new content.

# **PRD – Portfolio Website UX, Design, & Performance Upgrade**

## **1. Overview**

The goal is to elevate the **[https://laxmideepak-portfolio.vercel.app/](https://laxmideepak-portfolio.vercel.app/)** site’s professionalism, usability, and performance to better convert visitors (especially recruiters) into interview opportunities. Improvements will focus on **user experience**, **visual design**, and **technical performance**.

---

## **2. Objectives**

* Improve **navigation** and content flow for faster orientation and engagement.
* Enhance **visual hierarchy** and **branding consistency** to leave a strong, memorable impression.
* Reduce **page load times** and improve **Core Web Vitals** for SEO and user satisfaction.
* Ensure seamless **mobile responsiveness** and accessibility across devices.

## **3. User Stories**

### **Navigation & UX**

1. As a recruiter, I want clear navigation with visible section highlights, so I can quickly find relevant information.
2. As a hiring manager, I want a single click to access case studies for projects, so I can evaluate skills in context.
3. As a visitor, I want obvious calls-to-action (e.g., “View Work” / “Download Résumé”), so I know the next step without scrolling.

### **Visual Design**

4. As a user, I want a consistent color palette and type hierarchy, so the site feels cohesive and professional.
5. As a visual learner, I want optimized project imagery, so I can understand the work quickly without reading too much.

### **Performance**

6. As a mobile user, I want pages to load quickly and without layout shifts, so I can navigate smoothly.
7. As a returning visitor, I want assets cached and served quickly, so I don’t wait for reloads.

## **4. Functional Requirements**

### **Navigation & Layout**

* Sticky navigation with scroll-based height reduction.
* IntersectionObserver to highlight active section in navbar.
* Two CTAs in hero (Primary: “View My Work” → scroll to projects; Secondary: “Download Résumé” PDF).
* Project cards with title, one-line metric-based result, tech tags, and **Live/Code** buttons.
* Dedicated case study pages per project (Problem → Approach → Tech → Role → Metrics → Links).
* Contact form with inline validation, success/failure states, and mailto fallback.

### **Visual Design**

* 3-tone palette (background, primary accent, support color) with WCAG 2.1 AA contrast compliance.
* Typography: Inter/Geist for body text, Spectral for headings (via `next/font` with subsets).
* Images: All via `next/image` with defined width/height, `priority` for hero, `sizes` for responsive scaling.
* Hover/focus-visible states for all interactive elements.

### **Technical Performance**

* Font optimization: preload, subset, WOFF2 only, `display: swap`.
* Image optimization: AVIF/WebP, compressed to 60–70 quality, lazy-loaded below fold.
* JS optimization: React Server Components where possible, dynamic imports for non-critical libs.
* Preconnect & DNS-prefetch for fonts/analytics.
